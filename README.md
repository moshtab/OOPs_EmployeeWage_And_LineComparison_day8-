1) Employee Wage Calculation by Using Method

     I/P :- We have (Wage per Hour is 20),(Full day Hour = 8),(Part time Hour = 4),(Total working days =20);
     
     Logic :- We have to calculate total salary of employee for a month by using following formula.
              
              EmployeeWage=EmployeeWage+(WagePerHr*WorkingHr)
     
     O/P :- EmployeeWage 
 
 



2) Line Comparison Problem By Using Method

     I/P :- we have to take two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) for creating a line line1. And take another two points for line2; 
     
     Logic :- We have to calculate length of first line(line1) and length of second line(line2) by using following formula.
              
              Length of a Line = Math.sqrt(x2-x1)^2+((y2-y1)^2);
     
     O/P :- compare line1 and line2 whether they are equal or grater or smaller.
